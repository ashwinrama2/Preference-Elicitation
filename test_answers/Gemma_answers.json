Vectorization allows your code to process multiple data points with a single instruction, while parallelization involves dividing your code into multiple tasks that can be processed simultaneously. Combining these two strategies can lead to significant improvements in your code's performance on NERSC systems.\n\n**\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/>\n * <https://www.nersc.gov/users/getting-help/online-help-desk/>",

Identify the library and its dependencies:**\n- Review the documentation and source code of the library to determine its dependencies and required versions.\n- Check if the library is available in the NERSC module repository: `module spider`\n- If the library is not available, look for similar libraries that are installed on Perlmutter and see if you can use them as a substitute.\n\n**2. Use `module load` to load the necessary dependencies:**\n- If the library dependencies are available, use the `module load` command to load them.\n- For example, if the library requires `cray-hdf5` and `cray-netcdf`, you would run:\n\n```\nmodule load cray-hdf5\nmodule load cray-netcdf\n```\n\n**3. Build and install the library:**\n- If the library is not available, you may need to build and install it on Perlmutter.\n- Refer to the library documentation for instructions on how to build and install.\n- You may need to use the `module load` command to load additional dependencies required for building the library.\n\n**4.

    "12": "## Job Killing Issue\n\nIt appears that your job is being killed due to reaching the time limit on the queue. This is based on the information you provided in the `sacct` output and the \"Troubleshooting Jobs\" section of the NERSC documentation.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the situation:\n\n**Cause:**\n\n1. **Time limit on the queue:** The job requested a long walltime limit, which is causing it to be stuck in the queue for a long time. The documentation states that \"queue wait time correlates strongly with walltime request and weakly with the number of nodes.\" This means that jobs with longer walltime requests will have to wait longer in the queue.\n2. **Gaps in the schedule:** The way jobs are scheduled in Slurm is such that they are inserted into the first empty slot in the schedule that they fit into. This means that jobs with smaller walltime requests can sometimes start before your job even though it has a higher priority.\n\n**Possible solutions:**\n\n1. **Reduce the requested walltime:** If possible, you can reduce the requested walltime for your job. This will make it more likely to fit into the available slots in the queue.\n2. **Requeue the job:** You can requeue your job after it has been killed. This will put it back into the queue and it will be restarted when there is an available slot in the queue.\n3. **Use a different queue:** You can request a different queue with a different time limit. Please note that this may not be possible if the desired queue is full.\n\n**Additional resources:**\n\n* **NERSC Jobs documentation:** `sacct` command and \"Troubleshooting Jobs\" section:  <URL of the documentation>\n* **NERSC VASP documentation:** Long-time.sh example: <URL of the documentation>\n\n**Please note:**\n\nThis is based on the information you provided and I have not been able to access any additional details about your job or the system.

However, keep in mind that this file system is temporary and data is not preserved across jobs.\n* **Common:** If you need a more permanent storage solution and don't require the highest possible performance, the Common file system might be more suitable.\n\n**For small data sets:**\n\n* **Local Storage:** If you have small data sets that you need to access quickly within a single job, the local storage options like XFS or the temporary local file system might be the best choice.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Data Persistence:** If you need your data to be preserved across jobs, you should not store it on Perlmutter Scratch or the local storage options. Instead, you should use the Common file system or HPSS.\n* **Performance:** If you require high performance and low latency for your data access, Perlmutter Scratch and the local storage options are the best choices.\n* **Capacity:** If you have large data sets, HPSS might be the best option due to its high capacity.\n\n**It is important to note that:**\n\n* The information provided in this answer is based on the available sources and may not be completely comprehensive.
