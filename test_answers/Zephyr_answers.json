    "7": "As a member of the NERSC supercomputing center's support staff, I can provide you with instructions on how to use sshproxy. Sshproxy is a service provided by NERSC that allows you to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to obtain an ssh key that is valid for a limited time. Here's how you can use sshproxy:\n\n1. First, you need to download the sshproxy client script from NERSC's website. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```\n   scp myusername@dtn01.nersc.gov:/global/cfs/cdirs/mfa/NERSC-MFA/sshproxy.sh .\n   ```\n\n   Replace `myusername` with your NERSC login ID.\n\n2. Once you have downloaded the script, make it executable by running:\n\n   ```\n   chmod +x sshproxy.sh\n   ```\n\n3. Now, you can run the script by executing:\n\n   ```\n   ./sshproxy.sh\n   ```\n\n4. The script will prompt you to enter your NERSC password and one-time password (OTP) that you receive from your MFA device. Enter both of these values when prompted.\n\n5. After successfully authenticating, the script will install an ssh key and display a message showing the path to the key pair installed on your local computer and the expiration date and time for the keys. By default, the name of the files will be `~/.ssh/nersc` and `~/.ssh/nersc-cert.pub`.\n\n6. You can now use the ssh key to connect to NERSC systems without further authentication until the key expires.\n\n7. If you want to use a different name for the ssh key, you can use the `-o` option to specify the output filename when running the script. For example:\n\n   ```\n   ./sshproxy.sh -o mynersc\n   ```\n\n8. If you want to add the new key to your ssh-agent, you can use the `-a` option. This will also set the key with an expiration that matches the keys expiration so that ssh does not try to use the key after it has expired.\n\n9. If you have an old version of ssh (e.g., OpenSSH_7.2), you may need to use the `-a` flag. Otherwise, ssh and scp commands will require additional flags to work.\n\n10. If you are using a Windows machine, you can download the Windows executable of sshproxy from NERSC's website and follow the instructions provided in the documentation.\n\nI hope this helps!

    "12": "Based on the provided information, there are a few possible reasons why your job might be getting killed before finishing:\n\n1. Queue wait time: The most common cause of job termination is the queue wait time. Slurm makes a schedule every 5-7 minutes, and it tries to determine whether it can start each job right away without changing anything in its schedule. If your job requests a long walltime limit, it might get stuck indefinitely in the queue, and other jobs submitted after yours in the regular queue might start before yours. To avoid this, request a relatively short walltime (generally 4 hours or less) to fit into gaps at the front of the schedule.\n\n2. Resource contention: If your job is requesting a large number of resources, it might be contending with other jobs for those resources. This can result in your job being preempted or terminated to make room for other jobs. To avoid this, consider breaking your job into smaller tasks or using the preempt or debug_preempt queues, which are designed for jobs that can be preempted or restarted.\n\n3. Project balance: If your project has a negative balance, your jobs might be restricted to a subset of queues. This can result in your jobs being stuck indefinitely and you should consider killing them and checking your project balance.\n\n4. Resource limits: NERSC has resource limits in place to ensure fair usage of resources. If your job exceeds these limits, it might be terminated. To avoid this, check the resource limits for the queue you are using and adjust your job parameters accordingly.\n\n5. Resource usage: If your job is using a large number of resources, it might be exceeding the resource usage limits for the queue you are using. This can result in your job being terminated. To avoid this, consider breaking your job into smaller tasks or using the regular_m queue, which has higher resource usage limits.\n\nTo further investigate the reason for your job's termination, you can use the `sacct` command to view job accounting information, including the job's exit code, state, and resource usage. You can also use the `squeue` command to view the status of running jobs and the `scontrol` command to view the status of the Slurm control daemon. Additionally, you can use the `srun` command to submit jobs with specific parameters, such as the `--requeue` flag to specify that the job is requeueable, the `--open-mode` flag to append standard out/err of the requeued job to that of the previously terminated job, and the `--signal` flag to request that the batch system sends a user-defined signal to the batch shell before the job hits the wall limit. By using these commands and flags, you can gain more insight into the reason for your job's termination and take appropriate action to prevent it from happening in the future.\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/>",
    "13": "As a member of the NERSC supercomputing center's support staff, I can provide you with the following steps to kill all of your jobs:\n\n1. First, you can use the `scancel` command to cancel specific jobs. The syntax is `scancel $JobID` where `$JobID` is the job ID assigned by the Slurm scheduler. You can also cancel multiple jobs at once by separating their IDs with spaces, like this: `scancel $JobID1 $JobID2`.\n\n2. If you want to cancel all jobs owned by your user account, you can use the `-u` flag with `scancel`. The syntax is `scancel -u $USER`. However, we recommend using this option with caution, as canceling too many jobs at once can cause a degradation of service due to the high number of remote procedure calls sent to the Slurm daemon.\n\n3. If you prefer a more selective approach, you can use the `scontrol` command to update job attributes. For example, you can change the timelimit, QOS, or account of a job using the `scontrol update` command. The syntax is `scontrol update jobid=$JobID timelimit=$new_timelimit`, `scontrol update jobid=$JobID qos=$new_qos`, or `scontrol update jobid=$JobID account=$new_project_to_charge`, respectively.\n\n4. Before canceling all jobs, we recommend checking the status of your jobs using the `squeue` command.

Combining these two strategies can lead to significant improvements in your code's performance on NERSC systems.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/performance/parallelism>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/performance/vectorization>",

In the \"Account Settings\" page, scroll down to the \"Multi-Factor Authentication\" section and click on the \"Enable MFA\" button.\n\n4. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your MFA token. You can choose from a variety of authentication methods, such as an authenticator app, a security key, or a text message.\n\n5. Once you've selected your preferred method, follow the instructions provided by NERSC to complete the setup process. This may involve scanning a QR code or entering a code provided by the authentication method you selected.\n\n6. After you've completed the setup process, you'll be prompted to enter your MFA token in addition to your username and password when you log in to your NERSC account.\n\n7. If you ever lose your MFA token or device, you can follow the instructions provided by NERSC to reset your MFA tokens and set up a new one.\n\nRemember, MFA adds an extra layer of security to your NERSC account, making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access your data and resources. If you have any further questions or concerns about MFA, please don't hesitate to reach out to the NERSC support staff.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/mfa/#q-what-if-a-nersc-resource-doesnt-support-mfa-yet>",
    "19": "There could be a few reasons why you're having trouble logging in. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:\n\n1. Check your username and password: Make sure you're entering your NERSC username and password correctly. If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it by following the instructions on the NERSC website.\n\n2. Clear login failures: If you've entered your password incorrectly too many times, your login privileges will be disabled for 5 minutes. You can clear login failures by logging into your Iris account and selecting the 'Profile' tab. Click the 'Account Locked?' button and then click the 'Unlock Account' button in the dialog box that appears.\n\n3. Check your MFA settings: If you've enabled multi-factor authentication (MFA), make sure you're entering your one-time password (OTP) correctly. If you're using a mobile authenticator app, make sure the app is up-to-date and that your phone has a strong network connection.\n\n4. Check your network connection: Make sure you have a strong network connection to NERSC. If you're connecting from a remote location, try connecting from a different network or using a VPN.\n\n5. Check your firewall settings: Make sure your local firewall isn't blocking your connection to NERSC. You can test this by trying to ssh directly to a NERSC server using the command `ssh <nersc_username>@nxcloud01.nersc.gov`. If you're unable to connect, your firewall may be blocking your connection.\n\n6. Check your login history: If you've recently changed your password or enabled MFA, you may need to clear your login history. You can do this by logging into your Iris account and selecting the 'Profile' tab. Click the 'Login History' button and then click the 'Clear' button in the dialog box that appears.\n\n7. Contact NERSC support: If you've tried all of these steps and you're still having trouble logging in, contact the NERSC Account Support Office by sending an email to accounts@nersc.gov. They can help you troubleshoot any remaining issues.\n\nRemember to always follow NERSC's security policies and best practices to ensure the security of your account and data.\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/>\n * <https://www.nersc.gov/users/getting-help/online-help-desk/>",
    "20": "As a member of the NERSC supercomputing center's support staff, I can provide you with some guidance on which file system to use for storing your data.\n\nFirstly, it's crucial to understand that NERSC storage systems are designed to cover different needs for performance, capacity, and data persistence, and they are not disaster-proof data storage. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you have at least one copy of your data at another institution or cloud service, as NERSC does not keep multiple copies of data.\n\nBased on your specific use case, here are some recommendations:\n\n1. Home: This file system is intended for user-specific data and is accessible only to the user who owns it. It's a good choice for storing small to medium-sized datasets that are frequently accessed. However, it's not recommended for storing large volumes of data or for production I/O.\n\n2. Common: This file system is intended for project-specific data and is accessible to all members of the project. It's a good choice for storing large volumes of data that are not frequently accessed. However, it's not recommended for storing data that is being actively changed, as it does not support snapshots or backups.\n\n3. Community: This file system is similar to Common but provides snapshots and backups. It's a good choice for storing large volumes of data that are not frequently accessed and require snapshots or backups.\n\n4. Perlmutter scratch: This file system is intended for scratch space and provides high I/O performance. It's a good choice for storing large volumes of data that are being actively changed or require high I/O throughput. However, it's not recommended for storing data that needs to be persistently stored, as it's not a backup or archive file system.\n\n5. HPSS: This file system is intended for long-term storage of data that is not frequently accessed. It's a good choice for storing large volumes of data that need to be persistently stored and do not require high I/O throughput. However, it's not recommended for storing data that needs to be frequently accessed, as it's not a backup or archive file system.\n\nIn summary, the choice of file system depends on the specific use case, and it's essential to understand the intended use case of each file system. If you're not sure which file system to use, please consult with the NERSC support staff for further guidance.\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/performance/io/dvs/#read-your-data-from-the-right-place>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/archive/#best-practices>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/#summary>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/#local-storage>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/performance/io/#best-practices-for-scientific-io>"
