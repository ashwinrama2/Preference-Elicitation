    "3": "If you're planning to run a short job on a GPU at NERSC, you should consider using the \"shared\" QOS. This QOS is suitable for smaller tasks that don't require exclusive access to resources and are less likely to impact other users. However, keep in mind that GPU nodes in the shared QOS may have limited availability, so it's a good idea to submit your job promptly and avoid peak usage times.\n\nFor GPU jobs, you can also use the \"interactive\" QOS if you need a more flexible session, but note that these nodes are typically reserved for exploratory work and may have shorter walltimes.\n\nRemember to specify the `-C gpu` constraint in your job script to request GPU access. If your job is very short, you might not need to worry about walltime limits, but it's still essential to follow NERSC's guidelines to ensure fairness for all users.\n\nHere's a sample job script for a short GPU job using the shared QOS:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --nodes=1\n#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1\n#SBATCH --qos=shared\n#SBATCH --time=00:05:00  # Set your desired walltime (5 minutes in this example)\n#SBATCH --account=<your_account>\n\n# Your job commands here\nsrun your_script_with_gpu_usage\n```\n\nReplace `<your_account>` with your actual NERSC account.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/policy/#perlmutter-gpu>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/vscode/#running-on-a-compute-node>",

    "10": "If you need to install a library that is not currently available on Perlmutter, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check for community support**: First, verify if the library has a community-maintained package or a Spack recipe. Spack is commonly used for managing software dependencies at NERSC. You can find Spack packages for various libraries at <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>.\n\n2. **Create a Spack package**: If there's no existing Spack package, consider creating one yourself. Follow the Spack documentation (<https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/new_package.html>) to create a new Spack package for the library. This typically involves writing a `package.py` file that describes the package and its dependencies.\n\n3. **Install from source**: If you can't find a package, you'll need to compile the library from source. For Cray systems like Perlmutter, ensure you use the appropriate compiler wrappers (`cpe` modules) for the correct version. Here's an example:\n   ```shell\n   module load cpe/<the-non-default-version>\n   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CRAY_LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n   ```\n\n4. **Configure library build**: Depending on the library, you may need to configure the build with the correct options for your system. This might involve setting up environment variables for dependencies like HDF5 or NetCDF, as shown in the WRF build script example:\n   ```shell\n   export HDF5=$HDF5_DIR\n   export NETCDF=$NETCDF_DIR\n   ```\n\n5. **Build and install**: Once configured, build the library using the appropriate commands for your library, and then install it:\n   ```shell\n   ./configure\n   make\n   make install\n   ```\n\n6. **Update module files**: After successful installation, you might need to update your system's module files to include the newly installed library. This is typically done by creating a custom module file and adding it to the system's module path.\n\n7. **Load the new module**: Finally, use the `module load` command to load your custom module:\n   ```shell\n   module load your_library_name\n   ```\n\nRemember that installing from source can be complex, and you may need to adapt the process based on the library's documentation and requirements. If you encounter difficulties, consult the library's documentation, the NERSC User Support, or the library's community forums for help.\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/applications/wrf/wps/#example-build-script-for-the-jasper-external-library>",

    "12": "There could be several reasons why your job is being killed before completion, even if you've verified that there are no apparent errors. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. **Job Priority and Queue Wait Time**: As mentioned in the documentation, the queue wait time can be affected by the walltime requested, with longer jobs taking longer to start due to scheduling constraints. If your job requires a significant amount of time, it might be competing with other high-priority jobs, causing it to be preempted.\n\n2. **Resource Limits**: NERSC systems may have limits on resources like CPU time, memory, or disk I/O. If your job exceeds these limits, it could be terminated to prevent impacting other users. Check your resource allocation and ensure they are within the allowed bounds.\n\n3. **Queue Policies**: Some queues, like `debug` or `preempt`, have policies that allow for preemption if necessary. Make sure you are using the appropriate queue for your job's requirements.\n\n4. **Signal-based Termination**: Your job might be using a feature like checkpointing and restart, as seen in the examples provided. If the job is configured to checkpoint before the walltime limit, it might receive a signal (like USR1) to prepare for termination, which could result in it finishing its current checkpoint and exiting gracefully.\n\n5. **Error Detection**: Although you didn't find errors, there might be subtle issues that Slurm's monitoring system detects, leading to termination. You can review your job's accounting information with `sacct` to see if there are any unexpected events.\n\n6. **Software Issues**: Sometimes, bugs or misconfigurations in your code or dependencies can cause unexpected behavior. Double-check your code and dependencies to ensure everything is working as intended.\n\n7. **System Maintenance**: NERSC occasionally performs maintenance that could affect running jobs. If there's an underlying system issue, your job might be stopped temporarily.\n\nTo troubleshoot further, try the following steps:\n\n1. Review the `sacct` output for your job to see if there are any error codes, timeouts, or resource usage details.\n2. Check your `SBATCH` flags, especially the `--time` and `--signal` options, to ensure they align with your job's requirements.\n3. If using checkpointing, verify that your job is configured correctly to handle preemption and that it's not causing excessive resource consumption.\n\nIf you're still unsure, contact NERSC support with your specific job ID and details, as they can provide a more tailored analysis based on your job logs and system status.\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/checkpoint-restart/dmtcp/#perlmutter>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-jobs>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/checkpoint-restart/mana/examples/pm-cpu-mana-preempt-vt.sh>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/checkpoint-restart/mana/#perlmutter-cpu>",

For example, `-N 2 -c 128` allocates two nodes with 128 cores each, allowing for parallel processing.\n\n3. **Load necessary modules**: Ensure you load the required software modules for your application. For example, if you're working with VASP, use `module load vasp/your-version-cpu`.\n\n4. **Write a job script**: Create a `.slurm` script with the `srun` command to execute your program, like `srun -n <num_tasks> -c <threads_per_task> --cpu-bind=cores <your_program>`.

    "19": "There could be several reasons for a login failure at NERSC. Here are some common issues and their solutions:\n\n1. Incorrect password: If you've entered your password incorrectly ten times, your account may be locked for 5 minutes. Simply wait and try again after that time.\n\n2. MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): If MFA is enabled, make sure you're entering the correct One-Time Password (OTP) or following the instructions to unlock your account if it's locked due to too many failed attempts.\n\n3. Expired credentials: Check if your password has expired. If so, update it through the Iris portal.\n\n4. Login failures: Visit [Iris](https://iris.nersc.gov) and clear any existing login failures under your profile.\n\n5. Key-based authentication issues: If using ssh keys, ensure they are valid and not expired. You might need to manage your ssh-agent keys.\n\n6. SSH connection issues: Try connecting to the NoMachine server directly with `ssh <nersc_username>@nxcloud01.nersc.gov` to check if there's a network issue.\n\n7. Local firewall: Confirm that your local firewall isn't blocking the connection.\n\nIf none of these resolve the issue, open a ticket with the NERSC Help Portal at <https://help.nersc.gov> for further assistance.\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/nx/#troubleshooting-nx-connection-failures>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/mfa/#q-i-have-enabled-mfa-my-logins-fail-repeatedly-what-should-i-do>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/accounts/passwords/#login-failures>",
    "20": "When choosing a file system at NERSC to store your data, consider the following factors:\n\n1. **Purpose**: Different file systems serve specific purposes. For production I/O and high-performance access, use [Perlmutter Scratch](https://docs.nersc.gov//global/cfs/cdirs/nstaff/chatbot/production_code/data/nersc_doc/docs/filesystems/perlmutter-scratch/). This file system is optimized for fast access and is best suited for data that is actively used during a job.\n\n2. **Data Persistence**: If your data requires long-term storage and less frequent access, HPSS (Hierarchical Persistent Storage System) is more appropriate, but it does not offer snapshots or automatic backup.\n\n3. **Durability**: NERSC's file systems are not designed as disaster-proof storage. Ensure you have redundant copies of your data elsewhere.\n\n4. **Intended Use**: Do not use your home directory for production data. Instead, use the Common or Community file systems for project data, depending on whether you need snapshots and backup.\n\n5. **Scalability**: Large files and high concurrency can benefit from avoiding \"file-per-process\" models and preferring contiguous access.\n\n6. **Temporary Storage**: If you need temporary scratch space, use the per-node XFS file system for Shifter users or the local temporary file system on compute nodes.\n\nIn summary, for active, high-performance data, use Perlmutter Scratch. For long-term, less-frequently accessed data, consider HPSS. Always follow the guidelines for intended use and data management to ensure optimal performance and data security.\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/archive/#best-practices>"
