You can use tools like `module spider` or search the NERSC documentation to find out what modules you need to load for the library to build.\n   - Load the necessary CPE versions for the library and its dependencies using the `module load cpe/<version>` command. Make sure to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include the CPE library directories.\n   - Install the library using its build system or package manager (if available). For example, you might use `autoreconf`, `configure`, `make`, and `make install`.\n   - Verify the installation by checking for the presence of the library files and testing its functionality in your code.\n\n2. **Using Anaconda:**\n   - Create a new Anaconda environment tailored to your project requirements. This ensures that you have an isolated environment for your project and avoids potential conflicts with other packages.\n   - Activate the environment using `conda activate <env_name>`.\n   - Install the required library and its dependencies using `conda install <package_name>`.\n   - Verify the installation by importing the library in your script or testing its functionality.\n\nKeep in mind that these instructions are based on the information provided in the NERSC documentation and might need to be adjusted based on the specific library and your project requirements.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/development/compilers/wrappers/#use-cpe-modules-to-control-versions-of-cray-pe-modules>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/applications/wrf/wrf/#example-wrf-build-script-for-perlmutter>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/connect/#perlmutter>\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/environment/lmod/#module-hierarchies>",

In this case, you might not receive complete output from the job. To address this issue, consider resubmitting the job. (Source: <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/troubleshooting/#runtime-errors>)\n\n2. **Resource temporarily unavailable:** The error message \"Resource temporarily unavailable\" indicates that Slurm was unable to allocate resources for your job at the time of submission. This situation does not necessarily reflect an issue with your code, but rather a transient shortage of resources. It's possible that the issue has been resolved since you encountered it, so you can try resubmitting the job. (Source: <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/troubleshooting/#runtime-errors>)\n\n3. **Missing VASP license information:** If you're using the VASP code, the error message \"srun: fatal: Can not execute vasp_gam\" suggests that the user running the job does not belong to the VASP group. To access VASP, you'll need to provide the necessary license information following the instructions provided in the NERSC documentation.

    "13": "To cancel or terminate all running jobs under your account on NERSC systems, you can use the `scontrol` command with the `--kompil--` option. This command sends a SIGTERM signal to all processes associated with your jobs, allowing them to gracefully terminate. Please note that this action does not delete the job records from the scheduling system, but it will free up the resources they were using.\n\nFirst, identify the job IDs you want to cancel. You can list your current jobs using the `squeue` command and look for the columns containing your username or email address. Alternatively, you can use the `--me` option to display only jobs owned by the currently logged-in user:\n\n```bash\nsqueue --me\n```\n\nOnce you have identified the job IDs, you can cancel them using the following `scontrol` command:\n\n```bash\nscontrol cancel [job-ids] --kompil--\n```\n\nReplace `[job-ids]` with a list of comma-separated job IDs. For example, if you want to cancel jobs with IDs 123, 456, and 789, use:\n\n```bash\nscontrol cancel 123,456,789 --kompil--\n```\n\nKeep in mind that canceling jobs in this manner may lead to data loss if the jobs were in the middle of writing output files or performing critical calculations. If possible, it's recommended to save your work and manually cancel individual jobs when you're finished with them to avoid unintended consequences.\n\n\n\nReferences:\n * <https://docs.nersc.gov/>\n * <https://www.nersc.gov/users/getting-help/online-help-desk/>",

Check these files for any error messages that could help identify the issue. For JupyterLab servers launched on compute nodes, logs are written to `slurm-<job-id>.out` files in your home directory while the job is running. (Source: <https://docs.nersc.gov/services/jupyter/reference/>)\n\n2. **Accessing Compute Nodes:** To log into compute nodes running your jobs for troubleshooting or diagnostics, first identify the nodes your job is using by running `scontrol show job <jobid> | grep -oP 'NodeList=nid([.]+|.+)'`. Then, SSH into any of the identified nodes using your SSH key. Note that access to compute nodes is enabled only during the lifetime of the job. (Source: <https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/monitoring/>)\n\n3. **NERSC Accounts:** If you're unable to log in due to issues with your username or password, contact the NERSC Account Support Office at accounts@nersc.gov. For other login problems, open a trouble ticket from the NERSC Help Portal (<https://help.nersc.gov>). (Source: <https://docs.nersc.gov/iris/iris-for-users/>)\n\n4. **IP Addresses in Access Logs:** If you notice IP addresses in the 10.42.0.0/16 range in your web service access logs, this is likely due to the ingress controller logging the accesses as originating from its own IP address rather than the user's workstation. To change this behavior, configure your web service to obtain the IP address from the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header.
